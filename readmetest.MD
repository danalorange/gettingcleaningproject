### Intro
This repository hosts files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. The project uses data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set ("Smartphones Data Set") hosted at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This repo contains the following files:

* readme.MD - this readme file
* run_analysis.R - a script for generating the tidy dataset from the original Smartphones Data Set (see detailed description below)
* codebook.MD - the codebook for the dataset generated by run_analysis.R


### About run_analysis.R

This script does the following with the Smartphones Data Set:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set with the following steps
    +load training and test sets
    +load feature names from features.txt
    +combine the subject and activity_id data with the instrument measurements for the test and training sets 
    +rename the columns as "subject", "activity" and the feature names from features.txt
    +combine the training and test data into one dataframe
2. Extracts only the measurement columns containing the strings "mean" or "std".
3. Replaces the activity_id number with descriptive activity names from the file activity_label.txt
4. --Labels the data set with descriptive variable names-- (this is actually completed in 1d above).
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable by grouping the dataset by activity and subject and summarizing the other columns with the mean function. The prefix "avg_" is added to each column that now represents an average. 
6. Writes the dataset to a text file "results.txt"
